# 🌸 Mini-SIA: A Human Centered Agentic Assistant

Mini SIA is a human centered, agentic AI assistant designed to explore how intelligent systems should interact with people in everyday settings. Instead of functioning as a command driven chatbot, Mini SIA behaves like a considerate personal agent that adapts to user intent, energy, and emotional cues while remaining transparent, explainable, and fully user controlled.

The core philosophy behind Mini SIA is that intelligence is not just about completing tasks, but about understanding **when**, **why**, and **whether** to act. The assistant is designed to tolerate vague and informal input, respond naturally to idle or uncertain moments, and avoid forcing productivity when the user is tired or disengaged.

Mini SIA follows a clean agentic architecture in which a language model is used strictly for natural language intent understanding. All execution, state management, memory, and safety constraints are handled deterministically in code. This separation ensures predictable behavior, prevents uncontrolled actions, and keeps the system explainable.

The assistant is capable of detecting low-energy or tired states and can gently shift interaction toward lighter activities such as simple terminal based games. Importantly, Mini SIA never becomes autonomous by default. Any automatic behavior is enabled only after explicit user consent, and all preferences can be changed or revoked at any time. Users can also ask the system to explain its actions, allowing them to understand the reasoning behind a particular response.

In addition to its agent behavior, Mini SIA supports practical assistant functions such as daily task planning based on user energy, menstrual cycle phase tracking, journaling, and monthly meeting reminders. These features are intentionally scoped to support the assistant’s decision making rather than dominate it.

Overall, Mini SIA serves as a focused prototype for studying human AI interaction, trust-aware autonomy, explainable decision making, and ethical agent behavior in personal AI systems.



## 🔭 Ongoing Work

Mini SIA is currently being expanded further by adding additional capabilities such as deeper context awareness, richer planning and scheduling logic, enhanced wellbeing aware assistance, and broader interaction modes, while maintaining the same human centered and trust first design principles.
